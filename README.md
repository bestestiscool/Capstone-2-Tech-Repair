# üì± Repair Cost Estimator & YouTube Video Showcase Project

This project consists of two main components:
- **Repair Cost Estimator**: A tool for estimating repair costs based on device type, model, and the issue.
- **YouTube Video Showcase**: A page that displays a gallery of YouTube videos from a specific channel, along with video details.
- **Github Portfolio Showcase**: A page that displays a list of the available projects I have worked on.

## üöÄ Features

### Repair Cost Estimator
- **Multi-Step Form**: Users can choose the device type, model, and the issue they are facing. The cost is fetched from a PostgreSQL database.
- **Progress Bar**: A progress bar visually represents the user‚Äôs progress through the form.
- **Animation**: The form transitions smoothly between steps with animations.
- **Dynamic Cost Calculation**: Costs are fetched from the backend based on the user's input.

### YouTube Video Showcase
- **YouTube API Integration**: Fetches videos from a specific YouTube channel.
- **Pagination**: Displays videos in a paginated format.
- **Video Details**: Clicking on a video shows more details such as the description and duration, and plays the video in an embedded player.
- **Search Functionality**: Users can search videos by title.
- **Responsive Layout**: Videos are displayed in a neat 3x4 grid layout on larger screens and adapt to mobile devices.

### GitHub Portfolio Showcase
- **GitHub Intergration**: Fetches the latest version of my projects from GitHub. Allows the user to easily access the code.
- **Clean Layout**: Displays animations and buttons created with icons from awesomefonticons
